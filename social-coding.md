# Social Coding

### Git Rules

1. Create a Git repository for every new project
2. Create a new branch for every new feature
3. Use Pull Requests to merge code to Master

### Source Code Management

* Source Code Management is the practice of tracking versions of source code as it is being developed.&#x20;
* A source code manager (SCM) is a software tool used by teams of programmers to manage source code
* These are also referred to as Version Control Systems (VCS)
* SCMs can be Centralized or Distribute

#### Distributed or Centralized

* Distributed revision control (DRCS) takes a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems
* Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peerâ€™s working copy of the codebase is a bona-fide repository
* Distributed revision control conducts synchronization by exchanging patches (change-sets) from peer to peer

#### Decentralized systems

* No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies.
* Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.
* Communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling changes to or from other peers.
* Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, providing natural protection against data loss.

### Git: Decentralized SCM System

* A distributed source code management (SCM) tool invented by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development
* Code is kept in a repository and every developer has a full copy
* Works locally without any server
* Works remotely with GitHub, GitLab, & BitBucket

### GitHub: A website that hosts git repositories

* A web site that hosts git repositories
* Founded in 2007, has 40 million registered developers and was acquired by Microsoft for a whopping $7.5 billion in 2018
* Free and Paid accounts
* Adds ability to track Issues and Bugs
* Provides webhooks to integrate other tools

### Why You Need to Know Git?

* The use of Git and software code repositories has fundamentally changed the way enterprises do software development for proprietary code and open source code alike.
* In addition, open source software has blossomed because some of the Git repositories host open source code for free.
* Most significantly, Git and code repositories have facilitated the DevOps methodology that is so impactful to software development.
